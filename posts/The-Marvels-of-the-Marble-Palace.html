The city of joy has its own charms which makes the exhaustion of the scorching sun disappear, and walking the by lanes of Calcutta by Yo da just multiplies up this charm many folds.</p>

<p>Our plan was to visit Jorasanko Thakur Bari, the Kolkata adobe of the aristocratic Nobel laurate Rabindranath Tagore (I will put that up for another day). However, little did we know about another marvel very close to the Jorasanko Thakur Bari. Wandering on the streets near the Thakurbari, and looking for a Cha-Gumpti (Tea-stall. Bengalis don't shy away from having teas even under the scorching sun), we found this magnificent building right in front of us as we engaged in with some Kachuri and Chai. Like a hidden treasure, this mansion built with white marble in Muktaram Babu Street is rightfully called the Marble Palace.</p>

<p>The Marble Palace was built in the nineteenth century by Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur, a bengali merchant with a passion for collecting works of art. Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur was an art connoisseur and is said to have built this grand palace out of passion for preserving the exquisite works of art.
The mansion is famous for its marble walls and floors, the magnificient glasswares, the painting and a menagerie. It also has a Jaganath Temple within its premises built by Nilmoni Mullick, father of Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur. The palace has an exquisite collection of western sculptures, paintings, victorian furnitures and other antiques such as chandeliers, clocks, urns just to name a few. The museum has sculptures from Praxiteles to Phidias, Venus to Apollo, Homer to Diana and Mosses. There were original painting from famous artists such as Ruben, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Titian, Murillo, and John Opie. The most magnificent of all was the ball room, with two huge single aglass mirrors made of Belgium Glass. Three of us stood there mesmerized trying to imagine how the ball room might have looked during its time with all its decoration and the decorated lamps. It also contained the original nineteenth century disco balls. There were marble statues of ancient Greek and Roman mythology everywhere in the house. The palace is a fusion between neoclassical architecture and bengali house planning with a Reception Hall, Painting Room, Sculpture room, Billiards Room and Thakur Dalan (place of worship). The Reception Hall has sculptures depicting Autumn and Spring; Agriculture and Commerce; Summer and Winter; and Dawn and Night.TK</p>

<p>Besides art, Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur was also fascinated by wildlife. Much before there existed any Zoological Gardens in Kolkata, Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur had built himself a menagerie within the palace grounds. During its time it housed birds from different parts of the world. Later when the first Zoological Garden in Kolkata was ideated (behind which the Raja had been a great motivator), Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur made donation of some of his costliest collections to the Zoo. In honor to this act the Zoological Society named the first building in the campus as Mullick House. The menagerie still houses a aviary with few peacocks, hornbills, pelicans, storks, and cranes. It also contains a few species of monkeys and deer.</p>

<hr />

<p>At present the palace serves as the residence for Raja Rajendra Mullick's descendants and is maintained by them. Though entry is free, a prior permission from the West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau is required. The Jagannath Temple remains accessible to the members of the family only and continues it tradition of charity. Being a private residence photography is restricted.
We were amazed at what this relatively unknown place could hold. The elegance and the magnificence of the Marble Palace is really unbeatable, however it seemed to be quite unknown to the many tourists visiting Kolkata. This is a place that's worth a visit in Kolkata, to understand revolution of art and experience the western and victorian art and culture. It is claim to be one of the few well maintained palaces of Kolkata.</p>
